# Readme

His is a module that calculates and prints value-probabiliy distributions of dice rolls as commonly used in tabletop roleplay games such as 'Dungeon & DragonsÂ®'

# Examples

This shows the basic dice rolling syntax, and how the probabilities are expressed. Notice that the +5 inside the gwf function is stripped.

```python
from DnDice import d, gwf

single_attack = 2*d(6) + 5
print(single_attack) # dice: [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
print(single_attack.expectancies()) # [0.03, 0.06, 0.08, 0.11, ...]

great_weapon_fighting_attack = gwf(2*d(6) + 5)
print(single_attack) # dice: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ,9, 10, 11, 12]
print(single_attack.expectancies()) # [0.03, 0.06, 0.27, 0.49, ...]
```

Advanced syntax where the dice rolled are dependent on a first roll

```python
from DnDice import d, advantage, plot

normal_hit = 1*d(12) + 5
critical_hit = 3*d(12) + 5

result = d()
for value, probability in advantage():
	if value == 20:
		result.layer(critical_hit, weight=probability)
	elif value + 5 >= 14:
		result.layer(normal_hit, weight=probability)
	else:
		result.layer(d(0), weight=probability)
result.normalizeExpectancies()

plot(
	(normal_hit, "normal hit"),
	(critical_hit, "critical hit"),
	(result, "weighted by an advantage d20")
)
```
